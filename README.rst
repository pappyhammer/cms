Coding Medical Student
======================

############
Introduction
############

This project aims to provide medical students with tools to learn coding from scratch.
Thus empowering them to analyse clinical data, develop tools, review code written by others.

The project is designed to be accessible for novices at coding.

For now, the main language used will be Python.
Web design and applications development might be discussed later on.


Some of the objectives are:

* Manipulate tabular data
* Apply statistics
* Build graphics
* Use notebooks to share code and results
* Intro to machine learning
* Build models
